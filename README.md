# FlashCards with node.js

## About

FlashCards is a project where the learning goals were focused on OOP and Test Driven Development. Everything can be run on your terminal using node.js.

Some other goals include following the spec provided with the use of objects, testing suite, and ES6 classes.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

Make sure to run `npm test` in your terminal prior to playing the game.

## The Game

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal:

```bash
Node server running on port 3000
```

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:
